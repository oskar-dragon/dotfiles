Systematic 7-step workflow that transforms complex technical
problems into evidence-based, actionable decisions with
stakeholder buy-in.

✅ Key Points

- Sequential pipeline: /think → /options → /investigate →
  /deep-dive → /dependencies → /tldr
- Each command builds on previous outputs - always reference
  prior analysis
- Use for high-stakes decisions: architecture choices,
  technology migrations, complex problem-solving
- Transforms gut-feel decisions into documented, evidence-based
  processes
- Creates stakeholder alignment through transparent, systematic
  approach

🚀 Next Steps

1. Start with /session-start [decision-topic] for any major
   technical decision
2. Use /think [problem] to properly frame the problem before
   researching
3. Follow the sequence strictly - each step depends on the
   previous one

⚠️ Critical Notes

- Don't skip /think - jumping straight to /investigate leads to
  unfocused analysis
- Reference previous command outputs explicitly in each step
- Set decision deadlines to avoid analysis paralysis
- Create multiple /tldr versions for different stakeholders
  (exec, technical, ops)

📚 Resources

- Best for: Architecture decisions, technology choices, complex
  system problems
- Success pattern: Problem framing → Options → Evidence →
  Understanding → Impact → Communication → Action
- Session tracking: Use throughout to document insights and
  maintain context

This pipeline prevents costly technical decisions based on
incomplete analysis while ensuring all stakeholders understand
the rationale.
