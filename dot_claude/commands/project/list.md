description: List all projects with current phase and completion status
---

## Context

- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Vault directory: Current directory (assumes running from Obsidian vault)
- Available projects: !`ls .claude/specs 2>/dev/null || echo "No projects yet"`

## Usage

```
/project-list
```

## Your Task

**STEP 1: Locate Project Directory**

- USE current directory as vault
- CHECK for `.claude/specs/` directory in current location
- IF specs directory not found, provide guidance for setup

**STEP 2: Check Projects Directory**

IF `.claude/specs/` directory doesn't exist:

- INFORM user no projects found
- SUGGEST using `/project:01-create` to create first project
- EXIT with usage guidance

ELSE:

- LIST all subdirectories in `.claude/specs/`
- IF empty directory, inform user no projects exist

**STEP 3: Analyze Each Project**

FOR EACH project directory:

- READ project name from directory name
- CHECK which files exist (project.md, tasks.md)
- PARSE project.md to extract goal and motivation
- DETERMINE current phase based on file presence and task completion
- COUNT completed vs total tasks if tasks.md exists
- GET last modified date from newest file

**STEP 4: Determine Phase Status**

FOR EACH project:

- IF only project.md exists: Phase = "Planning"
- IF project.md + empty tasks.md exist: Phase = "Task Generation"
- IF tasks.md has tasks: Phase = "In Progress"
- IF all tasks marked [x]: Phase = "Done"

**STEP 5: Display Overview**

SHOW comprehensive portfolio view:

- Total project count and portfolio health
- Each project with name, goal, progress and last updated
- Visual indicators for completion status and momentum
- Suggested next actions for incomplete tasks

## Expected Output

Displays formatted list of all projects:
