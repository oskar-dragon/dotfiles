## Session Summary

**End Time:** 2025-07-03 11:45  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Status:** Completed Successfully

### Git Summary
- **Repository Status:** Not a git repository
- **Files Modified:** 1 file (`scripts/finish-meeting.sh`)
- **Total Changes:** Significant enhancements to Obsidian integration
- **Commits:** None (not a git repo)

### Todo Summary
- **Total Tasks:** 5
- **Completed Tasks:** 5
- **Remaining Tasks:** 0

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ Examine the current meeting.sh script to understand the workflow
2. ✅ Test the current script functionality with Raycast  
3. ✅ Debug why Obsidian needs to be manually opened
4. ✅ Fix Obsidian auto-opening and note creation
5. ✅ Test the complete workflow end-to-end

### Key Accomplishments

**Root Cause Identified:**
- Obsidian URI schemes (`obsidian://advanced-uri`) only work when Obsidian is already running
- Script was attempting to create notes without ensuring Obsidian was launched
- No fallback mechanisms for failed note creation

**Features Implemented:**

1. **Automatic Obsidian Detection & Launch**
   - Added `is_obsidian_running()` function using `pgrep`
   - Added `ensure_obsidian_running()` function with proper wait logic
   - Automatic launch with `open -a "Obsidian"` if not running
   - Wait up to 20 seconds for Obsidian to fully load

2. **Robust Note Creation with Fallbacks**
   - Primary: Advanced URI for note creation with content
   - Secondary: Direct file content insertion if URI succeeds but content missing
   - Tertiary: Complete file system fallback if URI fails entirely
   - Automatic directory creation for meeting notes

3. **Enhanced Error Handling & Verification**
   - Note creation verification by checking file existence and size
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging (auto-mode and manual mode)
   - System notifications for automatic completion
   - Proper error messages and user feedback

4. **Improved Reliability**
   - Extended wait time for note creation (5 seconds vs 3 seconds)
   - File size validation (>100 bytes for successful content insertion)
   - Automatic vault path detection for iCloud Obsidian vaults
   - Session isolation and cleanup

### Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
- `scripts/finish-meeting.sh` - Enhanced with automatic Obsidian launch and fallback mechanisms

**Key Code Changes:**
- Added functions: `is_obsidian_running()`, `ensure_obsidian_running()`
- Enhanced vault path detection: `$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/${VAULT_NAME}`
- Improved error handling with three-tier fallback system
- Better logging and user feedback mechanisms

### Problems Encountered & Solutions

**Problem:** Obsidian URI schemes fail when app not running
**Solution:** Added automatic detection and launch of Obsidian with proper wait logic

**Problem:** No verification of successful note creation
**Solution:** Added file existence and size checks with fallback content insertion

**Problem:** No fallback if Advanced URI plugin missing or misconfigured
**Solution:** Added direct file system creation as ultimate fallback

### Configuration Requirements

**User Configuration Needed:**
- Vault name already correctly set to "My Vault" 
- Advanced URI plugin recommended but not required (fallback exists)
- Meeting notes stored in "06 - MEETINGS" folder

### What Works Now

1. **Automatic Workflow:** Start → Record → Transcribe → Note Creation (all background)
2. **Reliable Note Creation:** Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure notes are always created
3. **Content Insertion:** Transcription content reliably inserted into notes
4. **Error Recovery:** Comprehensive error handling with user notifications

### Dependencies & Requirements

**Required:**
- Obsidian app installed
- SuperWhisper for transcription
- macOS (uses `open`, `pgrep`, `osascript`)

**Optional:**
- Advanced URI plugin (enhances functionality but not required)
- iCloud sync for Obsidian (path assumes iCloud storage)

### Breaking Changes
- None - all changes are backward compatible enhancements

### Lessons Learned

1. **URI Schemes Require Running Apps:** Always verify target application is running before URI calls
2. **Fallback Mechanisms Critical:** Multiple fallback layers ensure reliability
3. **File System Access:** Direct file creation provides ultimate reliability
4. **User Feedback Important:** Clear notifications help users understand what's happening
5. **Wait Times Matter:** Proper delays essential for app startup and URI processing

### Future Improvements

1. **Configuration Management:** Allow user to set vault path and folder structure
2. **Plugin Detection:** Check if Advanced URI plugin is installed and adapt behavior
3. **Error Logging:** Enhanced logging for troubleshooting
4. **Template Support:** Add meeting note templates
5. **Multi-Vault Support:** Handle multiple Obsidian vaults

### Tips for Future Developers

1. **Test URI Schemes:** Always test with app not running to catch edge cases
2. **Use File System Verification:** Don't trust URI schemes alone - verify results
3. **Layer Fallbacks:** Primary → Secondary → Tertiary approach ensures reliability
4. **Process Detection:** Use `pgrep` for reliable process detection on macOS
5. **Wait for Readiness:** Apps need time to fully load before accepting URI calls

**Script Testing:**
- Test with Obsidian running and not running
- Test with Advanced URI plugin enabled and disabled
- Test with various transcription lengths
- Verify all fallback mechanisms work correctly

The meeting transcription workflow now works reliably in the background without manual intervention.
