You can download it from [zed.dev](https://zed.dev) if you haven't already.\n\n2. **Ensure Inter Font is Available**:\n   - Inter is a popular open-source font designed by Rasmus Andersson\n   - It's often already installed on many systems, but you can download it from [rsms.me/inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) if needed\n\n## Configuring Inter as Your Font in Zed\n\n1. **Open Settings**:\n   - Use keyboard shortcut: `Cmd+,` (macOS) or `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux)\n   - Or click on the menu icon in the bottom left corner and select \"Settings\"\n\n2. **Edit Settings File**:\n   - Zed uses a settings.json file for configuration\n   - Add or modify the font settings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"editor\": {\n    \"font_family\": \"Inter\",\n    \"font_size\": 14,\n    \"font_weight\": 400\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. **Optional Font Customizations**:\n   - `font_size`: Adjust the number for larger or smaller text\n   - `font_weight`: 400 is regular, 300 is light, 500 is medium, 700 is bold\n   - `line_height`: Add this parameter if you want to adjust spacing (e.g., 1.5)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- If Inter doesn't appear, ensure it's properly installed on your system\n- Try using the full font name: \"Inter-Regular\" or \"Inter Regular\"\n- Check Zed's documentation for the latest font configuration options\n\n## Note\n\nZed's appearance settings might change with updates, so refer to the official documentation if these instructions don't match your version.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":39}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":12},"start":34,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":40}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":13},"start":1554,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":41}}}],"summary":"Using Inter in Zed Editor","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
